The aim of the project was to see differential RNA methylation in Austropuccinia psidii long read transcriptome

Austropuccinia psidii is an invasive fungal pathogen which is responsible for rust disease or myrtle rust on Myrtaceae. Myrtle rust is commonly seen in Syzgium jambos (rose apple) around Sydney. The disease causes deformed leaves, heavy defoliation of branches, reduced fertility, stunted growth and eventually plant death. The aim of the project is to see differential RNA methylation in Austropuccina psidii transcriptome as methylation on mRNA affects diverse aspects of RNA metabolism, including stability, splicing, alternative polyadenylation and translation.
